# LNbits
Free and open-source lightning-network wallet/accounts system

Either use https://lnbits.com, or run your own LNbits server!

LNbits is a very simple layer that sits on top of a funding source. LNbits includes unique API keys for each wallet, so funds can be partioned to avoid explosure.

The wallet can be used in a variety of ways, an instant wallet for LN demonstrations, a fallback wallet for the LNURL scheme, an accounts system to mitigate the risk of exposing applications to your full balance.

The wallet can run on top of any lightning-network funding source such as LND, lntxbot, paywall, opennode, etc

Please note that although one of the aims of this wallet is to mitigate exposure of all your funds, itâ€™s still very BETA and may in fact do the opposite!

## LNbits as an LNURL-withdraw fallback

Adding **/lnurlwallet?lightning="LNURL-WITHDRAW"** will trigger a withdraw that builds an LNbits wallet. 
An example use would be an ATM, which utilises LNURL, if the user scans the QR with a regular QR code scanner app, they will stilll be able to access the funds.
