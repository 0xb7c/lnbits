      LNURL is a range of lightning-network standards that allow us to use lightning-network differently. An LNURL withdraw is the permission for someone to pull a certain amount of funds from a lightning wallet. In this extension time is also added - an amount can be withdraw over a period of time. A typical use case for an LNURL withdraw is a faucet, although it is a very powerful technology, with much further reaching implications. For example, an LNURL withdraw could be minted to pay for a subscription service.

	Exploring LNURL and finding use cases, is really helping inform lightning protocol development, rather than the protocol dictating how lightning-network should be engaged with.
